Direct Diodes
Diode-Pumped Solid State (DPSS)

These are closely related types of lasers
Direct Diodes directly convert electric energy into light.
The choice of semiconductor determines the wavelength (color of emitted light, from ultraviolet to infrared)

DPSS lasers uses a Diode Laser that pumps lights into crystals (like Nd:YVO4 KTP crystals) (gain media) to get the final wavelength
More temperature dependent, more inefficient, more usage means weaker output, low efficiency (2-5% meaning 1 W in, could get 20 mW out)
Tighter more circular beam vs direct diode which is more rectangular output.

The reason why DPSS is used even though it seems worse than Diode is because not all wavelengths can be created using Diode lasers easily (like yellow wavelength)
but using DPSS this is achievable.

These are used in standard cheap laser pointers.
Typical red laser pointer have the following components:
Battery -> Laser Diode (LD) Driver -> Laser Diode Module

Typical green laser uses the following components (it is a DPSS)
Battery -> Pump LD Driver -> DPSS Laser Module

The DPSS laser module consits of:
Pump Laser Diode -> Pump Focusing Lens -> KTP Crystal -> Expanding Lens -> Collimating Lens -> IR Filter
