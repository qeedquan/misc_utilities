*** Commands
# Usually aliased as mail/mailx, for GNU systems this program provides the POSIX mailx functionality
# Configuration is stored inside $HOME/.mailrc or globally $SYSCONFDIR/mail.rc
# Sending mail invokes the program sendmail (which defines the default MTA, usually set to postfix/ssmtp/etc on Linux)
# By default, the MTA is usually setup so it can only deliver mail to local users
mail.mailutils

# Send mail given a RFC-822 formatted mail file, host can be DNS or IP
# The "To" field in the mail fail determines the user to send it to, accepted names to a remote host without DNS are the following:
# user@localhost, user@hostname_of_system
# This program will bypass the sendmail program and send the message by itself
mailutils send <host> <mail.file>

# Generate an example /etc/mailutils.conf
mail --config-help

# Send mail, the <user> field is based on the configuration of the MTA
# The mail can go to /var/mail/user in mbox format or $USER/Maildir, whether or not you can send mail to remote servers or localhost only it depends on the MTA configuration.
echo "my message" | mail <user>
