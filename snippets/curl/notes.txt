*** Certificates environment variables
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/ca.pem
export SSL_CERT_DIR=/path/to/certs

If SSL_CERT_DIR is specified, the certs in the directory need to follow a naming convention of
[HASH].0

To generate [HASH] given a .pem file, use 
openssl x509 -subject_hash -in root.cer
