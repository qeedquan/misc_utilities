*** DNS Records
Most common records normal servers serve:

SOA - Start of Authority. Defines the zone name, this will be the top level defining the other records as a child of it
NS - Name Server. Defines the authoritative name server(s) for the domain (defined by the SOA record) or the subdomain.

A - IPV4 address record
AAAA - IPV6 address record

MX - Mail records

CNAME - Canonical Name. An alias name for a host. Causes redirection for a single RR at the owner-name.
DNAME - Redirection in DNS. Like CNAME but affects all RRs below the address space of owner-name.

PTR - IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) to host. Used in reverse maps.

TXT - Freeform text to describe the server

*** Delegation
This refers to the way that the authoritative servers in the DNS namespace are 'found' by recursive servers.
Delegation is what happens when the administrators for a parent domain (e.g. test.com provides within its zone the details of the nameservers for mytest.test.com -
although this doesn't mean that the servers so named can actually answer any queries for names in mytest.test.com).
Having a zone delegated to your server doesn't (by itself) make it an authoritative server - it also needs to be configured to serve that zone.

Conversely, people sometimes are confused into thinking that their servers are not authoritative because there is no delegation to them.
However, there is nothing preventing a nameserver operator from configuring their server to provide an authoritative answer for a zone for which they have not been delegated authority, and many operators choose to do this for a variety of reasons.
Those servers are performing an authoritative function.

*** Primary and Secondary Servers
Secondary servers, even though they receive a copy of their zone data from a primary server, still answer queries authoritatively from locally stored zone data and not by recursing.
Secondary servers are authoritative servers for the zones they are publishing.
