*** Description
CDF are a way to add configuration parameters to the build process.

The CDF only gets a cursory syntax check when building the VSB, only in the VIP that all of the parameters are really expanded out

*** Quirks
There are some variations of CDF that seems to work in some VxWorks 6.9 version but not in others.
The CDF is passed through a C preprocessor so you can use

#ifdef/#define/#endif/#if/#error/etc

Some version of 6.9 allows you to use the macros at the top of a CDF file (outside of any blocks), but some versions do not allow this.
The versions that don't only allows you to use them inside a block like so:

Folder FOLDER_FOO {
#if defined(_WRS_CONFIG_SMP)
	...
#endif
}

Component INCLUDE_FOO {
#ifdef BLAH
	...
#endif
}

Parameter MY_PARAM {
#ifdef BAZ
	...
#else
	#error need baz defined
#endif
}

This is uniform in 7 where you can use the macros anywhere in the cdf file
