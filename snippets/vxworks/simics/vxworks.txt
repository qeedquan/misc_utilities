*** Building VxWorks for SIMICS
VxWorks has simics profiles with drivers that are compatible with simics:

qsp_ppc
qsp_ppc750
qsp_arm

They are booted using the uVxWorks image running u-boot

In the default VxWorks 6.9 install, there is no profile for simics, but simics ships with a BSP zip file
wrQspPpc
wrQspArm
that you can unzip into the VxWorks 6.9 installation directory
