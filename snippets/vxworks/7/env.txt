*** Setup

wrenv.sh setups the Linux environment, but need to specify the package name
wrenv.sh -v shows all the variables, use that to find package name

For old VxWorks installation, the script might fail to work with newer Linux distributions.
Need to modify it to make it work.

Examples:
wrenv.sh -p vxworks-7
wrenv.sh -p vxworks-6.6
wrenv.sh -p vxworks-6.9

Running the script will export WIND_* variables to use

Properties value and environment are defined in

$WIND_HOME/etc/wr.env.d

WIND_HOME              - top level install directory
WIND_BASE              - base directory to top level of vxworks folder
