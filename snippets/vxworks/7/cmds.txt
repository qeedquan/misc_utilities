*** Escape characters

This is handled inside the tty library code of VxWorks

Ctrl-H deletes some characters
Ctrl-U delete a whole line

https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.faq.html#xterm_erase
Unix shell usually maps Ctrl-? as delete, view this with the command 'stty -a'
This means that when run under QEMU with this mapping, the shell cannot handle the backspace character and spits out '?' instead of deleting correctly.
Need to remap the DEL in the terminal

*** Common C/command interpreter commands
kill - kill a process

*** C shell
cmd   - switch to command interpreter in C mode
kill  - kill a process
rtpSp - spawns an application
	rtpSp "app.vxe arg1 arg2 arg3"

putenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/romfs/lib;/romfs/other/lib");
	Set environment variable

checkStack(taskNameOrId)
	Display stack usage for specific task

bootChange()
	Changes the bootline (tries to save to nvram at address zero upon completion).
	If device tree is enabled however, it will not save to nvram as it gets the bootline from "bootargs" inside the device tree.

sethostname("new.host.com", strlen("new.host.com"))
	Set the hostname, by default it parses bootline field tn= for the name

hostAdd("example.com","192.168.1.1")
	Map a host name to IP, on Linux you would modify /etc/hosts
