*** RNDIS

RNDIS requires a USB TCD driver, and then USB RNDIS support to be compiled on top of it.
This will make an interface on startup, something like "usbEnd0"

# Set the IP for the usbEnd0 device
# The difference between the first and second command is that the second command will bring up the IP stack for it to be usable
# The first command will set the IP, but the device will not be able to send/receive packets
# However, the status field using ifconfig "usbEnd0" will show the device being UP using either command,
# so that UP field is not informative of whether the device is usable
> ifconfig "usbEnd0 172.16.0.1"
> ifconfig "usbEnd0 172.16.0.1 up"

On the host computer (Linux), it will detect a ethernet device
$ ifconfig "enx001122335500" 172.16.0.2 up

*** ifconfig

# set ethernet device to be promiscuous
ifconfig "gei0 inet promisc"

# set the MAC address
ifconfig "gei0 lladdr 00:11:22:33:44:55"

# set the IP address
ifconfig "gei0 192.168.1.1"

# restart the ethernet device
ifconfig "gei0 down"
ifconfig "gei0 up"
