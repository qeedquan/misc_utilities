INCLUDE_DISK_UTIL_SHELL_CMD
    cd, ls, cp, rm, mkdir, etc

INCLUDE_SHL
	Shared libraries

INCLUDE_RTP_APPL_USER
	Generates usrRtpAppInit.c for modification in the VIP to spawn new RTPs

INCLUDE_RTP_APPL_INIT_STRING
	Parses the string defined by RTP_APPL_INIT_STRING to run on startup

INCLUDE_PATCH_STANDALONE_DTB
	Overwrites the DTB on startup with existing bootline. This is to support old bootloaders/images that passes bootline to the kernel.

INCLUDE_ISR_DEFER
	Allow interrupts to defer tasks. For serial drivers without the DISABLE_DEFER flag, this include is needed or else the system will crash.

INCLUDE_NET_SYM_TBL
	Load the symbol table (vxWorks.sym) over the network so commands like lkup can be used

INCLUDE_STANDALONE_SYM_TBL
	Build the symbol table into the kernel image so commands like lkup can be used

INCLUDE_RAM_DISK
	Creates a RAM disk on startup, default format is RAWFS

INCLUDE_RAM_DISK_FORMAT_DOSFS
	Format the RAM disk created on startup with DOSFS

INCLUDE_IPWRAP_IPPROTO
	Add backward compatibility functions such as ipAttach()/ipDetach()

INCLUDE_PATHNAME_RESOLUTION_LEGACY
	Backward compatibility on how path names are resolved, some IOS filesystem implementations do not do full expand/checks on the path name.
	Those filesystems implementation will be broken, so this enables the old behavior where it does not check/expand symlinks, does not check for existence
	of the resulting path except the prefix must match some I/O device.

INCLUDE_TFFS_START_SECTOR_ZERO
	Backward compatibility with old TFFS formats (6.x and below).
	Old TFFS format store the header information at sector 0 while newer TFFS format store it at sector 1, making older VxWorks unable to read newer TFFS partitions and vice versa.
	VxWorks 6.9 seems to default to sector 1 though.

CONSOLE_NAME
	VIP option that specifies which TTY device will be the designated console output (default is usually /ttyS0)
