  <Text 220 730 12 #000000 0 "This simulation displays two-tone distortion characteristics.  Note that computation time is lengthy to obtain accurate results.  The\nlonger the time duration and the shorter the time interval, the more accurate results.  The time duration should be approximately\n100 / lowest frequency of interest and the interval should be an integer devisor of 1 / highest frequency of interest.  (This usually\nresults in more than 1000 intervals.)  Unless the DUT  (device under test) is meant to operate in a non-linear region, the two signal\nsources should be adjusted so that the power levels are within the approximate linear region of the amplifier.\n\nThis amplifier includes an active bias circuit since the collector voltage must operate very near the supply voltage, in this case less.\nthan 0.2 volts below the supply voltage of 3.0 volts  This type of circuit often exhibits low-frequency oscillations, modulating the carrier.\nThese can be prevented by modeling closed-loop stability of the complete circuit (phase margin at unity gain must be > 135 degrees).\n\nThe DUT output intercept can be determined by noting the ratio of the sidebands to the carrier and performing a simple calculation.\nExamining the above spectrum, the carriers are at +13.4 dBm and the sideband level is -11.5 dBm.  The ratio is then sideband level\nminus  carrier level or:  (-11.5) - (+13.4) = -24.9 dB.\n\nThe ouput intercept point is calculated by:  IP3out = sideband/carrier ratio + (2 times output level) or:  (-24.9) + 2(+13.4) = +1.9 dBm.  The\ninput intercept point is simply output intercept minus gain or:  IP3in = IP3out - gain in dB.  ">
