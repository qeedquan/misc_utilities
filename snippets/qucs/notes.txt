*** Projects
Projects need to end in _prj suffix
Projects are for linking multiple schematics together, you can create subcircuits and import them in different schematics

*** File Extensions
# Schematic file
.sch 

# Simulation data
.dat         - Qucsator
.dat.ngspice - Ngspice
.dat.xyce    - Xyce
.dat.spopus  - Spice OPUS

*** Algorithms

DC simulation uses Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)

AC simulation is small signal analysis in frequency domain, use Linear Modified Nodal Analysis (LMNA)
Non-linear components have to be linearized at the DC bias point. That is, before an AC simulation with non-linear components can be performed, a DC simulation must be completed successfully

Algorithms of these kind do not need to be iterative to solve the equations

The transient simulation is the calculation of a networks response on arbitrary excitations.
The results are network quantities (branch currents and node voltages) as a function of time.
Transient analysis is important for energy storing components, i.e. inductors and capacitors.

The MNA algorithm solves the equation of the following form:
A*x = z where A consists of 4 smaller matrices
A = [G B; C D]

*** External SPICE interface
External SPICE simulators can be used; to interact with it, use labels such as .PARAM or .IC

# .PARAM sections define new variables
y=5 # now we can use the variable y in the schematic

# .IC sections define initial conditions
v(out)=2.3 # initial voltage value is 2.3

*** Measurements

By default, simulating in SPICE does not automatically export all variables.
Need to add voltage/current probes to the schematic to see it in the diagrams.
