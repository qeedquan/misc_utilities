*** Prebuilt binaries

ARM provides prebuilt binaries for the GNU toolchain (gcc/gdb/etc)

https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain

For GDB, python support is provided via gdb-*-py binary but it uses shared libraries.
Need to compile python manually if distro packages don't have it

cd python-3.x
./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/path/to/python/install
make
make install

# Add it to the LD path so gdb can see it
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PATH:/path/to/python/install
