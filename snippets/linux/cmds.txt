# arping provides an easy test to see if an IP address is free. It broadcasts its request on the LAN (via link-layer address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff), and listens for a unicast response from a neighbor.

# Mounting img files, img files are raw disk images with partitions embedded inside, need to figure out where the partition starts in the file to mount it

# Get the offsets of the partitions in the image

# Some img files have partitions with partitions and fdisk only sees the first partition, we can use binwalk to get those partition offsets
binwalk /path/to/image

# With the knowledge of the offset, mount it by specifying the offset
