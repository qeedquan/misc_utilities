*** Installation
https://plugins.jenkins.io/synopsys-coverity/

This is an official Jenkins repository, you can also download the HPI offline install on there

*** Usage
This plugin adds a coverity config page to Jenkins

Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Synopsys Coverity
Need credentials to connect to "Coverity Connect" instance

*** Environment Variables
COVERITY_TOOL_HOME

*** Manual usage
Use cov-build command

*** Authentication
Jenkins can either use different methods to authenticate coverity.

# Username/Password
Create a user/password on the Coverity WebUI, then we can use those credentials.

# Auth Keys
To generate Auth Keys, go to the webui and click on Auth Keys.
Generate the keys and save it to a text file.
In Jenkins, choose "Secret File" and specify the Auth Keys

Authentication will fail if certificates are not setup properly

# List certificates
keytool -list -v -keystore /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts

# Store certificates
keytool -import -alias <alias_name_for_cert> -keystore /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts -file cert.crt

Whenever the keystore is updated, need to reload jenkins
# Reload jenkins
service jenkins restart

Reloading configuration from disk in the Jenkins webui does not work
