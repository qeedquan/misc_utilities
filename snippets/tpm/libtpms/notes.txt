*** Persistent Data
All of the persistent data is stored in NVRAM.
This is simulated by an array of memory that can be written to a file.
The size of the NVRAM is quite small, ~172 KB

The following data are considered persistent:

* The Hierarchies primary seed
* Authorization
* Proof
* Lockout/Owner policies

*** Objects
OBJECT is a structure that holds a data for public/private/metadata for a handle.
There is not that many objects in the system, by default MAX_OBJECTS is statically allocated and is only around 3.


*** Hierarchies
All hierarchies have a primary seed, on startup, the seed are generated by a RNG.
The seeds can be persisted in NVRAM.

HierarchyGetPrimarySeed() gets the primary seed:
PLATFORM, OWNER, ENDORSEMENT, NULL

*** Functions
CreatePrimary() -
Operates on an OBJECT, it tries to find an empty object slot when used.

SetPrimaryPolicy() -
Sets a policy on a hierarchy (LOCKOUT, PLATFORM, OWNER, ENDORSEMENT)
Expects a digest input and the hash algorithm associated.

Clear() -
Clears the proofs, the primary seed for SP, all policies.
Reset clocks, counters, reset PCR auth values and bump the PCR counter.
