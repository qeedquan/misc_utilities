# IMAGE_BOOT_FILES
A space-separated list of files installed into the boot partition when preparing an image using the Wic tool with the bootimg-partition source plugin.
By default, the files are installed under the same name as the source files.
To change the installed name, separate it from the original name with a semi-colon (;).
Source files need to be located in DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE. Here are two examples:
IMAGE_BOOT_FILES = "u-boot.img uImage;kernel"
IMAGE_BOOT_FILES = "u-boot.${UBOOT_SUFFIX} ${KERNEL_IMAGETYPE}"

# IMAGE_FSTYPES
Specifies the formats the OpenEmbedded build system uses during the build when creating the root filesystem. For example, setting IMAGE_FSTYPES as follows causes the build system to create root filesystems using two formats: .ext3 and .tar.bz2:
IMAGE_FSTYPES = "ext3 tar.bz2"

*** Wic
$ wic create mkefidisk -e core-image-minimal
