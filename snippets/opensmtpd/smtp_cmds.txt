*** MAIL FROM
MAIL FROM "test@client.net"
Initiates a mail transfer

*** RCPT TO
RCPT TO "user@recipient.net
The RCPT TO command specifies the recipient. As an argument, RCPT TO includes a destination mailbox (forward-path).
In case of multiple recipients, RCPT TO will be used to specify each recipient separately."

*** DATA
With the DATA command, the client asks the server for permission to transfer the mail data.
The response code 354 grants permission, and the client launches the delivery of the email contents line by line.
This includes the date, from header, subject line, to header, attachments, and body text.
A final line containing a period (“.”) terminates the mail data transfer. The server responses to the final line.

Example:
DATA
354 (server response code)
Date: Wed, 30 July 2019 06:04:34
From: test@client.net
Subject: How SMTP works
To: user@recipient.net
Body text

*** NOOP
The NOOP command is used only to check whether the server can respond. “250 OK” reply in response

*** VRFY and EXPN (OpenSMTP server disables this by default)
