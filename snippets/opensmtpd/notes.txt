*** Resources

*** Binaries
smtpd - The daemon program
smtpctl - Controls the smtp daemon

*** Configuration and Directories
# Main configuration file, this includes other files described below
/etc/smtpd.conf

# Table aliases, virtual user accounts redirecting to an existing user account can be set here
/etc/aliases

# Spool directory
/var/spool/smtpd

# Per user forwarding information
$HOME/.forward

*** Mail directories
By default, mail is delivered to $USER/Maildir, if the mail cannot be delivered it goes to the root user in a form of a file called dead.letter

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir
The format is Maildir
MDA such as dovecot is separate from SMTP server so it has to be specified the Maildir to read from in its configuration in order to serve it over IMAP

*** Send mail to localhost
echo "Email Body" | mail -s "Email Subject" user@localhost
echo "Email Body" | mail -s "Email Subject" user@hostname

MUA clients such as thunderbird can email using IP directly by specifying user@ip_addr in the to field.

*** Allowing any to send email
By default, opensmtpd only allows mail from localhost and listens on localhost.
To make it listen on any interface and accept email from any:

listen on 0.0.0.0
match from any for local action "local"

*** Debugging
Runs smtpd in the foreground and print out messages to terminal
smtpd -dv -T smtp 

If smtpd is already running use the following command to trace it
smtpctl trace <subsystem>

Trace both aliases/virtual/forward expansion and user/credentials lookups
smtpctl trace expand && smtpctl trace lookup

*** Delivery Status Notification
Delivery Status Notification is a feature when the server couldn't deliver the mail, it will send a notification email to the sender
To turn it off do:

listen on ... no-dsn (this will remove the DSN from the advertised EHLO)

*** Commands
# Check configuration file for syntax errors
smtpd -n

*** Configuration syntax
# Specify a table in a file, the <name> can be any unique id that can be referred to later in the config
table <name> file:/file/path/here

# macros, text that expand out to the string
ipv4 = "192.168.0.1"
ipv6 = "2001:db8::"
check = "pki example.com mask-src filter { check_rdns check_fcrdns } hostname example.com"
authcheck = "pki example.com auth <passwd> mask-src senders <users> filter { dkimsign } hostname example.com"

*** Credential files

The credential files store passwords for authentication, the file format is compatible with the dovecot program so they can share the authentication database

# Add a credential file to the config
table credentials passwd:/etc/mail/credentials

# Inside credentials, generate passwords using the smtpctl command
smtpctl encrypt example_password1

# Example entry of the complete output
john@example.com:$2b$10$_EXAMPLE_PASSWORD1_C3JbO4Ns2jJNZQfTS45MAnKi.IPrkKITyTa6:vmail:2000:2000:/var/vmail/example.com/john::userdb_mail=maildir:/var/vmail/example.com/john
