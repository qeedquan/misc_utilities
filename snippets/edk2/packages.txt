	Builds the EFI memory map that passes on through the bootloader

EFI allocates alot of memory so the memory map it passes to the bootloader is alot of entries.
The bootloader usually will merge the maps into one contiguous blocks where it can.

The following types are mergable into usable memory:
3, 4, 7

ACPI tables are type 10 usually and they can't get merge

------------------------------------
EfiReservedMemoryType = 0
Not used.

EfiLoaderCode = 1
The code portions of a loaded application.

(Note that UEFI OS loaders are UEFI applications.)

EfiLoaderData = 2
The data portions of a loaded application and the default data allocation type used by an application to allocate pool memory.

EfiBootServicesCode = 3
The code portions of a loaded Boot Services Driver.

EfiBootServicesData = 4
The data portions of a loaded Boot Serves Driver, and the default data allocation type used by a Boot Services Driver to allocate pool memory.

EfiRuntimeServicesCode = 5
The code portions of a loaded Runtime Services Driver.

EfiRuntimeServicesData = 6
The data portions of a loaded Runtime Services Driver and the default data allocation type used by a Runtime Services Driver to allocate pool memory.

EfiConventionalMemory = 7
Free (unallocated) memory.

EfiUnusableMemory = 8
Memory in which errors have been detected.

EfiACPIReclaimMemory = 9
Memory that holds the ACPI tables.

EfiACPIMemoryNVS = 10
Address space reserved for use by the firmware.

EfiMemoryMappedIO = 11
Used by system firmware to request that a memory-mapped IO region be mapped by the OS to a virtual address so it can be accessed by EFI runtime services.

EfiMemoryMappedIOPortSpace = 12
System memory-mapped IO region that is used to translate memory cycles to IO cycles by the processor.

EfiPalCode = 13
Address space reserved by the firmware for code that is part of the processor.

EfiPersistentMemory = 14
A memory region that operates as EfiConventionalMemory, however it happens to also support byte-addressable non-volatility.
