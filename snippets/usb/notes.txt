*** Descriptors

Descriptors are structures that describe the device function and capabilities.
The descriptors are usually described in the device datasheet,
there are also overview documents that describe the descriptors for a whole generic group of device like a card reader.

On Linux use lsusb -v to see the descriptor for that device.

The descriptors also describe endpoints that the host can talk to.

A device can have multiple Interface descriptors that serves different functions, ie, a card reader can also serve as a mass device storage.

*** Transfer type

Control. Control pipes are used primarily to send commands and retrieve status. Control pipes are intended for non-periodic, host-initiated request and response communication of small-sized structured data. Control pipes are bidirectional. The default pipe is a control pipe. See The Default Pipe.

Bulk. Bulk pipes are used primarily for data transfer. Bulk pipes offer reliable transportation of large amounts of data. Bulk pipes do not necessarily deliver the data in a timely manner. Bulk pipes are unidirectional.

Interrupt. Interrupt pipes offer timely, reliable communication of small amounts of unstructured data. Periodic polling often is started on interrupt-IN pipes. Interrupt-IN pipes return data to the host when the data becomes present on the device. Some devices have interrupt-OUT pipes. Interrupt-OUT pipes transfer data to the device with the same timely, reliable “interrupt pipe” characteristics of interrupt-IN pipes. Interrupt pipes are unidirectional.

Isochronous. Isochronous pipes offer a channel for transferring constant-rate, time-relevant data, such as for audio devices. Data is not retried on error. Isochronous pipes are unidirectional.
