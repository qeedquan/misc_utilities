*** Architecture

Serial twisted wire (differential signaling)
No master device, shared bus

Message arbitration use ID as a priority (lower is higher, 0 bit overpowers 1 bit)
Each payload has a ID so they can discern who sends what

Dominant voltage (bit 0), high - low > 0
Recessive voltage (bit 1) high - low ~ 0

Data Link Layer
64 bit in CAN frame
11 bit ID (29 bit for extended CAN)

*** Setup a virtual CAN on Linux
# Load the VCAN driver
modprobe vcan

# Add a CAN virtual device
ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
ip link ls

# Enable up the CAN virtual device
ip link set up vcan0

# Generate random data to vcan0 for applications to read from
cangen vcan0

# Send custom data to vcan0
cansend vcan0 123#112233445566771122

# Dump the data from vcan0 to stdout
candump vcan0

# Log to a file
candump vcan0 -l

# Replay the log and send it to the CAN bus
cat candump.log | canplayer
