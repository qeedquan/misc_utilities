*** Files

Makefile.in -
Generated from Makefile.am, some projects only check in the .in files for consumption.
Another way to generate Makefile.in is through autoconf.
This file can also be made by hand in some cases.

Makefile.am -
A programmer-defined file and is used by automake to generate the Makefile.in file (the .am stands for automake)

configure.ac -
Used by autoconf to make a configure script

*** Automake files

Automake sometimes requires helper programs so that the generated Makefile can do its work properly. There are a fairly large number of them, and we list them here.

Although all of these files are distributed and installed with Automake, a couple of them are maintained separately. The Automake copies are updated before each release, but we mention the original source in case you need more recent versions.

config.guess -
config.sub -
These two programs compute the canonical triplets for the given build, host, or target architecture.
These programs are updated regularly to support new architectures and fix probes broken by changes in new kernel versions.
Each new release of Automake comes with up-to-date copies of these programs.
If your copy of Automake is getting old, you are encouraged to fetch the latest versions of these files from https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=config before making a release.

*** Commands
# A script provided by autotools
# It runs autoconf and autoheader as needed, run in the top dir of source tree usually
autoreconf --verbose
