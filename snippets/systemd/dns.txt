If the systemd resolver is used, /etc/resolv.conf will have a line that says
nameserver 127.0.0.53 (The IP is a special IP where systemd listens on and process DNS queries)

systemd-resolved does not expose how it pick which DNS servers to use for querying, it might be different for each query.

***

# Show the DNS servers currently in use
resolvectl status

# restart the resolver (reload config changes/etc)
systemctl restart systemd-resolved

# File or folder that contains the configuration of the resolver, modify this instead of /etc/resolv.conf
# and reload it for systems using systemd to do resolvers
/etc/systemd/resolved.conf

***

# Specify a custom DNS server and domain
DNS=192.168.1.5
Domains=example_domain.xyz
