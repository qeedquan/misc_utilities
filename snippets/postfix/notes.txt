*** Files
/etc/postfix is the usual location for configuration files

main.cf - contains the global configuration of Postfix.
master.cf - specifies Postfix interaction with various processes to accomplish mail delivery.
access - specifies access rules, for example hosts that are allowed to connect to Postfix.
transport - maps email addresses to relay hosts.
aliases - contains a configurable list required by the mail protocol that describes user ID aliases. Note that you can find this file in the /etc/ directory.
virtual - kind of like aliases but for virtual user mappings

Template files that list common options that postfix supports
main.cf.proto
master.cf.proto

*** Authentication
SMTP servers need to decide whether an SMTP client is authorized to send mail to remote destinations, or only to destinations that the server itself is responsible for.
Usually, SMTP servers accept mail to remote destinations when the client's IP address is in the "same network" as the server's IP address.

SMTP clients outside the SMTP server's network need a different way to get "same network" privileges. 
To address this need, Postfix supports SASL authentication (RFC 4954, formerly RFC 2554).
With this a remote SMTP client can authenticate to the Postfix SMTP server, and the Postfix SMTP client can authenticate to a remote SMTP server.
Once a client is authenticated, a server can give it "same network" privileges.

You can also use a firewall in front of postfix as another filter

*** Running on different port
Modify master.cf and change

smtp      inet  n       -       y       -       -       smtpd

to be

<newport> inet  n       -       y       -       -       smtpd
