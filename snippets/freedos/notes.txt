*** Sharing files
To share files between host and FreeDOS, networking can be used.
FreeDOS provides a FTP server.

Another way is to make an iso that can be mounted as a cdrom.
genisoimage -o files.iso -V FILES -R -J /path/to/files/

Use the raw image format in QEMU so the filesystems can be mounted easily.

For the floppy disk, it can be formatted using the 'format' command in freedos and written to.
The host can mount the floppy image as normal.
