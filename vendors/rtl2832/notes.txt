*** Stations
Can decode Wide FM and Narrow FM.

Narrow FM has a much smaller bandwidth than Wide FM so looks like a small pulse peaking at around -60 DB.
Wide FM is much easier to see as it's much larger in bandwidth and the peaks at around -70/-80 DB.

NOAA weather broadcast uses Narrow FM, go to
https://www.weather.gov/nwr/county_coverage for a list of frequencies to listen at.

Wide FM is used by regular radio stations heard in a car radio.
Look up local radio stations to tune in.

AM range is in the KHZ range so the RTLSDR cannot tune in without a upconverter.

rtl_fm -f 106.1e6 -M fm -s 170k -o 4 -A fast -r 48k -l 0 -E deemp | aplay -r 48000
