Arduino compatible board with a LoRa radio chip transceiver capable of 433 mhz or 868/915 MHz
The frequency is not strict, can send a little outside of the range like at 950 mhz.

LoRa operating frequencies (these are license-free bands):
169 MHz, 433 MHz (Asia), 868 MHz (Europe) and 915 MHz (North America).

*** Using the radio
Easiest way is to solder an 16 AWG wire to act as a quarter wave whip antenna.

The wire length is derived from the formula:
468/frequency * (12/2) = wire_length
frequency is in mhz
wire length is in inches

433 MHz - 6.5 inches, or 16.5 cm
868 MHz - 3.25 inches or 8.2 cm
915 MHz - 3 inches or 7.8 cm

The length does not have to match exactly, just close enough, the chip will set the frequency it wants to transmit on and use it.

*** Capturing output
Can capture the LoRa transmission using RTLSDR via GQRX when it sends. Tune to the frequency it is sending at and should see a short burst of energy whenever it sends.
