USB uvcvideo interface, Linux can capture directly (use opencv).
Windows has an app on site to view the camera.

Lens on the camera is for covering the eye when not using it, it makes everything under focus quite blurry.
To use the microscope, need to remove the lense on the outside and then hold the object to magnify as closely to the eyepiece.
The quality is ok, we can use it to view PCB traces/text on chips.
