Uses bluetooth, sets it up as a keyboard device that copies the the text it scans to the clipboard when it scans the 1D barcode.
If notepad/text editor is opened, it copies and pastes that scanned number to the editor.

Usually that code is underneath the barcode in text print, the barcode scanner is just a fast way to get that number from the barcode.
Sometimes the text code underneath is not the whole code though, so the barcode has more information.

Around 30 feet range

Can't put the barcode too close or else it can't detect it

Uses red light ~630 nm

*** LED states
Paired:     top light is orange
Not Paired: top light is off

There is no USB cable on it, bluetooth is the only connection you can do.
