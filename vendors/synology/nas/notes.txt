A NAS has a bunch of hard drive slots compatible with SATA/NVME drives.
Usually runs Linux serving the hard disks over the network. Allows a centralized file storage location for various computers.

Upon connecting to the network, it negotiates with the router for an IP, then the user can connect via a web browser on port 5000.

The web interface presents a desktop that has apps to do the following:
Configure/Format the hard drive
File services (SFTP/SSH/SMB/NFS/etc)
Health monitoring
Backup configuration
Permissions
View logs
Fan Speeds
View/Modify/Delete/Download files on the hard drive

*** NFS
The /path location is given through the NFS web interface
Uses a whitelist to allow IPs

mount -t nfs -O user=user,pass=pass 192.168.1.1:/path /mnt/nas

Add this to /etc/fstab to allow users to mount the folder
192.168.1.1:/path   /mnt/nas    nfs    rw,relatime,user,noauto   0   0
