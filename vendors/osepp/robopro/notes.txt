Kit to make a 2 wheeled robot. Cost ~$100.
The board is based on Arduino Uno so can use the Arduino IDE to program it.
Provides a library to control motors and sensors:

https://www.osepp.com/oseppRobot.zip is the Arduino library

No soldering, comes with screwdrivers to screw the parts into place.

*** Parts

Aluminum chassis with holes for placing the Arduino main board, motors, sensors on it.
Uses screws to hold them together.

CH341 USB-UART converter module to use the USB cable to program it.

USB-UART cable

Contains a battery pack with a wire to hook to the board. Uses a lot of medium size AA batteries.
The USB cable can be use to power the MCU though not for the motor.
To use the motor, need to use the battery pack, it enable it with a toggle button.
Serial or something else on the MCU can just work off the USB power supply though if no battery.

Two motors for the two wheels

A motor driver chip that controls both of them

Ultrasonic range sensor (40 khz)

Line sensor

Arduino compatible MCU.
