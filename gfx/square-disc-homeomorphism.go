In practice there are a few common LP norms that are common to measure distances between things:

L1

Benefits:
- Sparsity: The L1 norm encourages sparsity in solutions, making it useful in feature selection and situations where you want to minimize the number of active features (e.g., Lasso regression).
- Robustness: It is less sensitive to outliers compared to the L2 norm, as it does not square the values.
- Geometric Interpretation: The L1 norm corresponds to the Manhattan distance, which can be more intuitive in certain applications.

Drawbacks:
- Non-differentiability: The L1 norm is not differentiable at zero, which can complicate optimization processes.
- Solutions Can Be Ambiguous: In some cases, solutions may not be unique (multiple solutions can yield the same L1 norm).

L2
Benefits:
- Differentiability: The L2 norm is differentiable everywhere, which makes it easier to optimize using gradient-based methods.
- Sensitivity to Magnitude: It gives more weight to larger values due to squaring, which can be beneficial in certain applications where outliers are relevant.
- Geometric Interpretation: The L2 norm corresponds to the Euclidean distance, which is often the most natural measure of distance in many applications.
- Rotationally invariant: Rotating a vector and then measuring the length does not change the length.

Drawbacks:
- Sensitivity to Outliers: The squaring operation can make the L2 norm overly sensitive to outliers, potentially skewing results.
- Less Sparsity: It does not promote sparsity in the same way that the L1 norm does, which can lead to more complex models.

Loo [max(x1, x2, ..., xi)]
Benefits:
- Robustness to Small Changes: It is robust to small perturbations in the vector, focusing only on the largest deviation.
- Simplicity: The calculation is straightforward, as it only requires finding the maximum absolute value.
- Useful in Certain Contexts: It can be useful in optimization problems where the worst-case scenario is of interest.

Drawbacks:
- Non-differentiability: Like the L1 norm, the Lâˆž norm is not differentiable, which can complicate optimization.
- Less Informative: It provides less information about the overall distribution of values in the vector compared to the L1 and L2 norms.

Given a topological space X and Y we can have a map that is homeomorphic if
it satisfies 3 properties:

1) bijective
2) continuous
3) continuous inverse

A unit square [-1, 1] can be map into a disc centered at 0 with radius of 1 with the formula

p(x, y) = 0 if (x, y) is (0, 0)
p(x, y) = max(abs(x), abs(y)) / length(x, y)

where length(x, y) is the l2-norm for a disc, we can use other length(x, y) from (1..2) as a way to slowly "morph"
the square to a disc, in general a square is homeomorphic to a disk in the lp-norm where the inverse is

p'(x, y) = length(x, y)/max(abs(x), abs(y)) where (x, y) is in the lp-space
