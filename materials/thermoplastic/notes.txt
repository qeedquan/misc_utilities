*** Definition
Substances (especially synthetic resins) that become plastic on heating and harden on cooling, and are able to repeat these processes.

A thermoplastic is a class of polymer that can be softened through heating and then processed using methods such as extrusion, injection molding, thermoforming and blow molding.
Thermoplastics harden once cooled and do not show any changes in chemical properties after being heated and cooled multiple times, making them easily recyclable.

The opposite of these types of material are thermosets which are resin, that hardens permanently after one application of heat and pressure.
