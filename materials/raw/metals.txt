*** Anodizing

Anodizing is an electrochemical process that creates a protective, corrosion-resistant layer on the surface of a metal part.
The process is often used on aluminum and its alloys, but can also be used on other nonferrous metals like magnesium and titanium.

1. The metal part is immersed in an acid electrolyte bath.
2. An electric current is passed through the bath.
3. The metal part acts as the anode, releasing oxygen ions that combine with the metal atoms to form an oxide layer.

Sandblasting is an optional process before anodizing that can cover machine marks.
