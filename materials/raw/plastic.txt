1. Plastics are produced from natural gas, feedstocks derived from natural gas processing, and feedstocks derived from crude oil refining.
   Crude oil is the raw material, get from drilling

2. Refine the oil by heating it, the liquid form like petroleum can be split using a temperature chamber, each stage has a different temperature.

3. Extracting pure gas substances from the raw oil, each substance in the liquid has a temperature point where it becomes a gas (boiling point),
   so subject it to different temperatures in each chamber to make it into a gas that dwells in a particular chamber

4. The extracted pure gas substances like Ethane/Propane are the building blocks for plastics

5. Use fracking to break the molecules Ethan/Propane to make Ethlyne and Propylene (monomers)

6. Polymerization to combine the monomers into polymers like PVC/Polyethelyne/Polyester), this makes the standardized plastic pellets (nurdles) which customers can buy in bulk

7. Mold/shape the plastic pelletes using techniques like extrusion/molding/etc
   Different molding techniques include rotational molding, injection molding, blow molding, compression molding, extrusion molding, and thermoforming


8. Cool and then solidify

9. Add additives to make different colors, flame retardation, etc
