*** Overview

Plating makes material more resistant to abrasion/corrosion, change its lubrication, reflectivity, conductivity parameters, or make it look nicer.

*** Electrical connectors

Contact plating, usually done at the end of the process (finishing).

Electrical connectors are usually plated one of the following:

Noble Metals (Noble metals are desirable because they lack chemical reactivity and resist oxidation and corrosion.)
Gold
Platinum
Silver
Palladium
Rhodium

Transitional Metals
Tungsten and Molybdenum

Passive Metals (high corrosion resistance. An oxidation layer creates a film on the metal's surface that prevents further corrosion.)
Tin
Nickel

Other (These metals will corrode, but they are cheap. A protective layer of another metal can limit corrosion.)
Copper

Alloys (Combination of materials):
Bronze
Palladium Nickel
Electroless Nickel

*** Techniques
Electroplating/Electrodeposition: Coating via electric current
