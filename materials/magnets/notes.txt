Substances can be diamagnetic, paramagnetic, or ferromagnetic.

Paramagnetic
    It is very weakly attracted to a magnet.

Diamagnetic
    Materials are weakly repelled.

Ferromagnetic
    Iron, cobalt, nickel, their alloys (such as the many kinds of steel) probably a few others are ferromagnetic.
    They are very strongly attracted to magnets and greatly amplify magnetic fields that pass through them.
