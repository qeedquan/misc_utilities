*** Sheets

# Indium Tin Oxide
Clear, conductive liquid/film.
On a sheet, it can be used by a laser cutter to pattern it.
It's not possible to solder to this material, but you can use conductive inks, paints, copper tape (with conductive adhesive) and alligator clips to make contact.

*** Wiring

# Ferrules
Any sort of ring used to either reinforce a shaft or bind together strands of a material.
In the context of wiring, a ferrule is a small deformable metal tube, generally made out of tin plated copper.

*** Instruments
# SMU
A source measure unit (SMU) is a test instrument that combines the functions of a power supply, digital multimeter, current source, electronic load, and pulse generator into a single unit.

# Multimeters
A multimeters is a test instrument that can measure multiple things (usually an ammeter, voltmeter, ohmmeter all in one).
Every multimeter has a category rating where it has a maximum voltage/current it can measure, if it exceeds it, it will be damaged.

An ammeter used to be non-inductive, you have to cut open the wire and attach the meter to it to measure.
Nowadays they come in a clamp where you wrap it around the wire to measure it (inductive measurement).

*** PCB Form Factors

# SOIC
Surface mounted components, for simpler boards with less layers
Easier to debug than QFN since you don't need to remove the solder mask to gain access to the PIN

# DIP
Dual-Inline package, the PINs are sticking out of the chip, can be placed into breadboard/through-holes easily, mainly for prototyping
Usually the DIP IC connects to something called a DIP-PIN socket, then the PIN connects to the breadboard/etc

# QFN/DFN
Quad/Dual-flat no-leads
Surface mounted components, like SOIC but used for more layers (QFN is smaller in size and use less area than SOIC)

# BGA
Surface mount, harder to inspect each joint vs QFN, the joints are under the components, usually use X-Rays for inspection
BGA are smaller and compact than QFP

# PCB Test Points
These things are like hooks that you can solder on to the board, they have a hole that you can connect alligator clips/probes to to measure voltage/current

# Chip On Board
Chip on board (COB) is a method of circuit board manufacturing in which the integrated circuits (e.g. microprocessors) are attached (wired, bonded directly) to a printed circuit board, and covered by a blob of epoxy
This shows up as black spots on the board

# PCB Conformal coating
Conformal coating is a lightweight material applied to PCBs that acts as a protective layer. It protects circuit boards and components against various environmental factors, including heat, humidity, moisture, ultraviolet light, chemical contaminants, and abrasive materials.
Alternative to PCB potting

# PCB Potting
Potting, also known as “encapsulation”, is a method to seal the PCB within a thick layer of resin which provides strong protection against physical shock and harmful chemicals, meanwhile, this process will enhance the electrical performance.

*** Tools

# Power Supply/Batteries/Battery eliminators (another name for adjustable power supply)
Supplies power to the circuit

# Soldering Iron/Solder
Used to glue together components onto the circuit board

# Solder Cup
Used for soldering of wires, creating a secure connection, while the contact end allows a pin or lead to engage and disengage repeatedly and consistently.

# Flush Diagonal Cutters
Use to trim wires and leads off of components after soldering them

# Solder Sucker/Desoldering Pump
Used to suck solder out for desoldering components off the boards
Heat up the solder with a soldering gun, then apply the solder sucker to suck the solder out

# Helping Hand/PCB clamp holder
Holds the PCB in place with a magnifying glass so inspection can be done
Also helps with soldering components into the PCB

# Perfboard/Stripboard
Like a breadboard but for easy soldering the components

# Smart Tweezers
Tweezers with sensors on it so we can measure things more easily than sticking probes to the small components

# Wire Spools
Wires wrapped in a spool, the wires can be cut off using a wire cutter, useful for custom wire lengths

# IC hook
Wire strands can connect at the body and then the top side has a hook that allows you to clamp the pins on the board to make a connection

# Sparkgap transmitter
Old type of radio transmitter by electric sparks. Sparkgap wave forms look like spikes (pulses)

# Pry Tool Kit/Prybars
Prying toolkits contain various trim tools to pry open cases/etc

# Offset screwdrivers
Can act like a screwdriver or a prybar

# Rotary tool
A motor connected to a tip, the tip can be various things on it for different tasks, a generic name for a tool that rotates

# Felt Polishing Tip
Hook to a rotary tool, it can scrape off materials like epoxy

# Grommet
Ring or edge strip inserted into a hole through thin material, typically a sheet of textile fabric, sheet metal or composite of carbon fiber, wood or honeycomb.
Grommets are generally flared or collared on each side to keep them in place, and are often made of metal, plastic, or rubber.
They may be used to prevent tearing or abrasion of the pierced material or protection from abrasion of the insulation on the wire, cable,
line being routed through the penetration, and to cover sharp edges of the piercing, or all of the above.

# Heat Gun
Gun that can output high temperature (200-1400) F

# ESD Mat
A mat that electronics can be placed on for work

# Vise
Secure an object to allow work to be performed on it, kind of like clamper.

# Mechanical Integrator
Integrate functions mechanically, works by have a spinning wheel thats rotates at a rate based on the input, the total rotations it does over time gives the integral of the function

*** Drone terminologies
ESC: Electronic Stability Control. Stabilizes your system when it begins to veer off your intended path. 

BEC: Battery-eliminating circuit. Basically just allows you to use the ESC to power the controls circuit, servos, etc. (hence eliminating the need for a battery)

SBEC: Switched battery-eliminating circuit. Just an improved version of the BEC which makes it more energy efficient.

UBEC: Similar to SBEC, just more energy-efficient at the expense of being slightly heavier.

Opto: Uses light (optocoupler) to segregate control and motor circuits, to reduce interference. Therefore requires two sources of power, one for the controls and one for the motor.

*** Resonators

# Helical 
A helical resonator is a passive electrical component that can be used as a filter resonator. (bandpass)
Physically, a helical resonator is a wire helix surrounded by a square or cylindrical conductive shield. One end of the helix is connected to the shield and the other end is left open

# Cavity
A cavity resonator is a closed metal structure that confines electromagnetic waves and is used in microwave and optical systems: 
There is usually holes that the waves go through (cavities) that keeps the waves confined by reflecting them back and forth in the cavity

*** Power Supplies

# Linear
A linear power supply uses a transformer to reduce the voltage.
The ratio of primary windings (connected to the mains) to the number of secondary windings (connected to the output) would give the ratio of how much the voltage reduced by.
For Example: 240 to 12 V is a ratio of 20:1 reduces the 240 volts AC input in to 12 volts AC on the secondary windings.

# Switching
A switch mode supply works by turning the mains electricity on and off very quickly to reduce the voltage.
In this case the reduction in voltage depends upon the ratio of the on time and off time. Switching takes place very fast, at 10,000 times a second or quicker.
Using this technique the bulky transformer found in a linear supply can be replaced with a smaller one.

The AC signal is rectified and regulated to produce a high DC voltage. This is then switched on and off rapidly by a FET.
Then the switched signal goes through a transformer, although this can reduce the voltage it isolates the output from the mains electricity (for safety reasons).
Feedback of the output is then used to control the mark space ratio of the switching so that the output stays at the required voltage.

# Transformers used in Linear/Switching
There are two types of transformer, those used at low frequencies (50Hz) in a linear power supply and the high speed (>10KHz) version used in switch mode supplies.
The linear power supply transformer typically uses a steel core.
Because eddy currents would occur in a solid steel core and reduce the efficiency the core is made from insulated steel plates stacked next to each other with the windings wrapped around them.

Ferrite toroid (donut shaped) cores work much better with higher frequencies and are used in switch mode supplies.

*** Rubber Stopper

A rubber enclosure that acts like a sealing for vials/test tubes/electronic ports/etc

*** Thread Taps

Metric Taps are used to cut and restore internal threads precisely. A tap is used to form the female component of the assembly, as in the case of a nut or socket.
