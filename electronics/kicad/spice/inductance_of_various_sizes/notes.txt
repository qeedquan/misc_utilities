Here are three circuits which are identical except for the size of the inductors in them. A larger inductor (higher inductance) has more opposition to changes in current. 
The inductor on top is the largest, so the current flow is smallest in that circuit; the AC source is constantly trying to change the current,
and the large inductor is best at opposing those changes.

If we measure in Spice with a constant AC input,
we can see larger inductance means less current,
and measuring at various inductor points (Lx) and (Rx),
we can see that they are 90 degrees apart.
