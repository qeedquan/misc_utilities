Electric Box -
It's a box where you route electric wires (romex, etc) through the box, connecting to other boxes.
It serves as a location where the wires are cut and twisted together and connected via switch (one-pole, two-pole, etc)

For some boxes, you need to punch holes in the four corners opening to route the wire; do that first before nailing the box to the wall

The most commonly used screw size for securing electrical outlets is a 6-32 machine screw.
The “6” refers to the diameter of the screw, and “32” refers to the number of threads per inch.
This specific size is commonly used across the United States for mounting electrical devices such as outlets, switches, and wall plates to electrical boxes.
It’s the industry standard and fits most residential and commercial installations.

The length of the screws for an electrical outlet can vary depending on the installation requirements. Generally, 1-inch screws are standard for most applications.
However, in situations where the electrical box is recessed deeper into the wall, longer screws-
up to 2 inches—may be necessary to reach the mounting points securely.

The boxes store the wires, but a handy cover is needed to cover the outside (sold separately)
