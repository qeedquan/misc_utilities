*** Switches
3 way toggle switch has 4 screws for 4 wire connections
1 way toggle switch (single pole) is 3 screws for 3 wire connections

The neutral line is usually not wired on the screw but spliced to another wire

For romex wires:
Black is hot
White is Neutral
The non-colored one is ground

Black (hot) wires connects on the same side of the screws

If the connection is not proper, ie, black on the same screw side as ground, it creates a short.
If the connection is lose and the wires fall off the screws, it creates electrical arcs

To connect the romex wires onto the screw, strip the wire out to expose the wire, make sure the wire is straight first
Then use a wire stripper hole opening to twist the wire into a U, then put in on the wire, screw it in, and then complete the U shape into an O to lock it in

*** Coverings
After the switch is installed, it usually needs something called a faceplate/wallplate to cover it.
A wall plate is for switches installed in a wall, faceplate are for switches not necessarily installed in the wall.

Depending on the number of switches, a different wall plate must be used to cover them, they are called N-Gang wallplates where N is the number of switches
Example:
1-Gang Wall Plate
2-Gang Wall Plate
3-Gang Wall Plate
