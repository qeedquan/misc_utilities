The conduits are usually sold as a straight pipe, we need to bend it for various installations.
Use a conduit bender to bend it.
30/45/90 degree bends are the most common.

For very precise bends or angles that are hard to bend by hand, use machines to do it.
These machines are in the thousand dollars range though, so need volume for it to be useful
