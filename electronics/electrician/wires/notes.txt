*** AWG-Conductors Notation
Wires are formatted as Gauge-Conductors
Example:
14/3 - wire is a 14-gauge, 3-conductor (plus ground)
14/2 -two 14-gauge copper conductors—a hot (black) and a neutral (white)—plus a ground wire

The first field is how thick the wire is (in terms of AWG), smaller AWG means the wire can hold handle more current (amps)
The second field is how much conductors are inside when you strip the wire, it also has grounds so the total number of wires is always (conductors + 1) wires.
If the second field is left blank (ie, 14 AWG or so), it means there's 2 wires, one conductor and one ground inside.
