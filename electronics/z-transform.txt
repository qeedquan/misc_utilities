*** Mapping from s to z domain

Ts = sampling time (1/fs)
ws = 2*pi/fs

s = σ + jw
z = exp(σ*Ts + jw*Ts) = exp(σ*Ts)*exp(σ*jwTs) = |z|*exp(j*theta)
|z| = exp(σ*Ts)
theta = w*Ts

All of the LHP maps inside the unit circle
σ < 0

All of the RHP maps outside of the unit circle
σ > 0

The imaginary axis gets mapped to the circumference of the unit circle
σ = 0

From this we know that:
Stable - All poles inside the unit circle
Marginal Stable - All poles is inside or on the unit circle
Unstable - Any pole outside of the unit circle

*** Mapping z to s domain
There is no unique mapping of z to s since
s = 1/Ts * ln(z)
ln(z) = ln(z) +- j*2*n*pi

This makes sense because sampling creates an infinite number of spectra, each is centered around +-n*ws
