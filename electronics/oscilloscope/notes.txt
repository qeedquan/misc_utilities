*** Cabling
Usually uses BNC connectors

*** Performance
Bandwidth is the most oscilloscope specification

All oscilloscopes exhibit a low pass frequency response
The frequency where an input sine wave is attenuated by 3dB is the scope bandwidth
-3db is ~30 amplitude error (20*log(Vo/Vi))

Required bandwidth to capture:
Usually need >= 3x highest sine wave frequency for scope to get a good view
>= 5x for highest digital clock rate

*** Types of probes
Analog and digital, digital is more used nowadays

Many different kind of probes (high frequency, high voltage, current, etc)

Most common type of probe is Passive 10:1 voltage divider probe

Passive 10:1 Voltage Divider Probe
It is a passive probe that reduces the amplitude of the signal delivered to the scope BNC input by 10x, also increase input impedance by 10x
All measurements performed relative to ground
Low frequency model/DC model: Can view this probe as a the following circuit:
Probe input <-> 9 Mohm <-> Scope input (1 Mohm termination resistor inside the scope)

*** Terms

DSO - Digital Storage Oscilloscope
CRO - Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (Old analog type scopes)
MSO - Mixed Signal Oscilloscope (includes logic analyzer channels of acquisition)

Passive: No active elements such as transistors or amplifiers
