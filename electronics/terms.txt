*** Mott Voltage
Mott voltage is related to the Mott transition, which is the transition between a metallic state and an insulating state in a material.
The Mott transition can be triggered by a number of factors, including temperature and carrier density.

Mott insulators are a class of materials that are expected to conduct electricity according to conventional band theories, but turn out to be insulators (particularly at low temperatures).

Mott criterion
The Mott criterion is a measure of whether a material will be conductive or insulating. If the density of electrons is high enough, the material will be conductive, or metallic.
If the density is not high enough, the material will be insulating.

Mott insulator to metal transition
The Mott-insulating state occurs when the repulsive Coulomb potential is large enough to open an energy gap.
The Mott transition occurs when the Mott-insulating state transitions to the metallic state. 

One of the simplest models that can capture Mott transition is the Hubbard model.

*** Filters and Transducers
If	the	input	and	output	have: a	same unit, the system is categorized as a “filter”
-	electrical	filter	(V->V,	A->A),
-	mechanical	filter	(m->m),	optical	filter	(E->E),
-	digital	filter	(number	->	number)

different	units,	the	system	is	categorized	as	a	“transducer”
-	force-to-displacement	actuator	(m/s^2->m),
-	electro-magnetic	actuator	(V->m/s^2),
-	displacement	sensors	(m->V)
-	electrostatic	transducer	(C	(charge)	->	N/m^2	(sound))
-	transimpedance	amplifier	(A->V),	current	driver	(V->A)
-	gravitational	wave	detector	(“gravito-optic	modulator”)

*** DFM/DFA/DFT/CMM

Design for manufacturing - product made with ease of manufacturing in mind
Design for assembly - product made with ease of assembly in mind
Design for testing - design techniques that add testability features to a hardware product design.
Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) to measure and inspect parts, ensuring accurate and repeatable measurements throughout the manufacturing process. 

*** Ground Potential Rise (GPR)
A phenomenon that occurs when large amounts of electricity enter the earth.
This is typically caused when lightning strikes at Cell towers.
Dangerous for living things near by, one way to mitigate is to install electrodes 

Earth Potential = Soil Resistivity x Current / (2 x PI x Distance)


The grounding engineer needs three (3) pieces of information to properly conduct a Ground Potential Rise Study:
1. Soil resistivity data from a Soil resistivity Test
2. Site drawings with the proposed construction
3. Electrical data from the power company

# Moving average / FIR
y[n] = b0 x[n] + b1 x[n−1] + … + bq x[n − q]
then time series analysis would call this a moving average (MA) model of order q, provided b0 = 1. Note that this might not really be an average, i.e. the b‘s are not necessarily positive and don’t necessarily sum to 1.

Digital signal processing would call this a finite impulse response (FIR) filter of order q.

# Autoregressive / IIR
If each output depends on a linear combination of a finite number of previous outputs

y[n] = a1 y[n −1] + … + ap y[n − p]

then time series analysis would call this an autoregressive (AR) model of order p.

Digital signal processing would call this an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter of order p.

Sometimes you’ll see the opposite sign convention on the a‘s.

# ARMA / IIR
If each output depends on a linear combination of a finite number of previous inputs and outputs

y[n] = b0 x[n] + b1 x[n-1] + … + bq x[n − q] + a1 y[n − 1] + … + ap y[n − p]

then time series analysis would call this an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model of order (p, q), i.e. p AR terms and q MA terms.

Digital signal processing would call this an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter with q feedforward coefficients and p feedback coefficients. Also, as above, you may see the opposite sign convention on the a‘s.

# ARMA notation
Box and Jenkins use a‘s for input and z‘s for output. We’ll stick with x‘s and y’s to make the comparison to DSP easier.

Using the backward shift operator B that takes a sample at n to the sample at n-1, the ARMA system can be written

φ(B) y[n] = θ(B) x[n]

where φ and θ are polynomials

φ(B) = 1 − φ1B − φ2B² − … φpBp

and

θ(B) = 1 − θ1B − θ2B² − … θqBq.
