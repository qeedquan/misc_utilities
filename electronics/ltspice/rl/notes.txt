An inductor acts to impede the current flow, slowing it down on, providing
a ramp time to start and stop. This is governed by the equation

I = I0 * (1 - exp(-t / tau))
tau = L / R

Inductors can be added using formula
series:
Lt = L1 + L2 + L3 ...

parallel:
1/Lt = 1/L1 + 1/L2 + 1/L3 ...

In a simple inductive circuit (circuit with just V, I, and L elements)
V = I/Xl
Xl = 2pifL

Where Xl is the reactance and its units is in ohms, following ohm's law

For phase calculations of simple inductive circuits, voltage is always at 90 degree from current

Q Factor - The quality factor to quantify how effective resistance in an inductor is
Q = Xl/R, higher Q is better than lower Q because it is easier to add additional resistance if needed,
but it is harder to add more reactance
