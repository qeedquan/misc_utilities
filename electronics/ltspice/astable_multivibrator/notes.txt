A classic circuit to switch between two states in a fixed duration time with some frequency is
known as a astable multivibrator, it is made using two transistors coupled with an rc network.

The RC network feeds into the transistor and as the capacitor charges/discharges, it will enable/disable
one transistor while enabling the other transistor, leading to a two state with some duty cycle.

If we want each transistor to be on for the same amount of time, have the same capacitor/resistor values,
if we want one to have more duty cycle, change the resistor/capacitor value fed in, ie, less resistance
means faster charging time, and that leads to more switching and hence more time for the other transistor to run.
