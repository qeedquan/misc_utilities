*** Port Forwarding
A normal configuration is as follows:

Computer -> Router -> Modem -> Internet

The modem is provided by the ISP, the router can be bought such as netgear/cisco/etc.
The router by default assigns an internal network IP (Ex: 192.168.x.x) to the computer and uses the WAN IP from the modem (the public IP that internet will use to route to us)
If we want to be able to let computers from the internet to connect to us through a port, enable port forwarding for the port so that all requests from the public internet will route to the internal ip at that port, otherwise it will be blocked.

*** ReadySHARE
Readyshare is a Netgear Product

Readyshare was created by Netgear to share services through their various products.

One of it's purposes is to advertise storage from their line of routers and/or wifi access points. It allows you to use a USB device in the router or other Netgear product to share it to other users within your private network. Files can be written to and/or read from the device.

Attributes of Readyshare
Network Storage
Streaming multimedia files within your LAN
File Sharing
Print Sharing
TCP port 20,005
Shares over wireless and wired connections within the LAN

*** UPnP

UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a network protocol that allows apps and devices to open and close ports automatically in order to connect with each other.
UPnP requires zero configuration â€” you can add a new device to your network and have it automatically connect with your other devices.

UPnP is a way to make port forwarding automated and easier than a manual process.
For example, if you want to connect a printer to everyone in your household without UPnP, you would need to connect the printer to every single device. UPnP automates this.

*** NTP
Routers can use NTP to sync time, it usually has a default NTP server it talks to or you can specify a custom one for it to use.

*** Blocking
Routers has the feature of blocking things based on:

Keyword blocking - match domain names and block them
Service blocking - block a specific type of service

They can be blocked on a per schedule basis (days to block, start and end time of the day)
They can also be overriden by specifying a trusted IP

Upon blocking, the router can notify by sending an email to a specified server.
The router can periodically send an email at a set interval with the log.

*** Traffic meter
Routers can have an option for traffic metering where it can restart/warn/etc if a limit set (in number of bytes downloaded/uploaded) is hit

*** DDNS
Routers can setup to use a DDNS service

*** VPN
Routers can be setup to use VPN (usually it uses OpenVPN)

*** Ping heatmap
Given a set of servers IPs, a router can generate a map of latencies of how long it takes to ping hosts, this is useful for figuring which server has the lowest latency

Normal latencies:
16-20 ms for within a big country
100-200 ms for country to country with good infrastructure
200-500 ms for country to country with bad infrastructure
