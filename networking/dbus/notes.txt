---Conventions

Uses reversed domain name convention to identify resources
org.freedesktop.PowerManagement
com.Skype.API
org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.clementine 

A unique name is of the form, the app can request
a familiar bus name (domain name above though)
:1-45
:2-16

Each app/service can have multiple object paths represent a unique
object within the application

---File locations
These are for customizations
/etc/dbus-1
system-local.conf

These are for defaults
/usr/share/dbus-1
system.conf
session.conf

After modifying the files, need to reload dbus to take effect
systemctl reload dbus

---Buses
System Bus:
System wide services runs here, meant to allow programs to connect and
utilize its services, examples include bluetooth daemon, hplip printer
drivers, and other programs of that nature.

By default, DBUS configuration policy disallows a user creating a service
on this bus without an opt-in configuration file policy, can create a catch-all
configuration file though, for development purposes.

Session Bus:
Local programs per user login session, programs such as audacious
media player and gnome screensaver are such examples, they are meant to provide
different customization for each user session

---Debugging tools
d-feet: GUI tool to view dbus services/attribute
dbus-monitor: command line tool to sniff dbus traffic

For these tools to look at the services that an object expose, the object
needs to implement the Introspect method that gives all the metadata on it,
otherwise it will error out
