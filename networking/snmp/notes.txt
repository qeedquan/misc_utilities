-- List all the oid->text
snmptranslate -Tl

-- List all variables on snmp server, subagents will update
-- the list once it's running, change localhost to <server>
snmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 localhost .

-- On many distros snmp.conf disables MIBs loading by default
-- need to modify /etc/snmp/snmp.conf to remove line
mibs :
-- to enable loading MIBS, or else MIBS won't be looked up and can't
-- resolve any variable names

-- By default, snmpd.conf restrict access to variables, as a hammer use
rocommunity public
rwcommunity private
-- to enable setting/seeing all variables, this is for accessing
-- subagents variables

-- subagents can be compiled and run as standalone programs
-- to allow custom handlers for variables, run under master agentx provided by snmpd.
-- to make snmpd listen on a port as a master agent: add "agentXSocket tcp:localhost:705" in snmpd.conf

-- to add local custom MIBS file, put them in $HOME/.snmp/mibs
-- modify $HOME/.snmp/snmp.conf with
mibs +MY_MIBS_FILE
-- to add them to the search path

-- packages needed
-- need package snmp-mibs-downloader to get a complete mibs info

-- agents can send traps but it cannot recieve them, need a trap daemon running to catch it
