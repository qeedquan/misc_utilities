/*

In Las Vegas, a roulette wheel has 38 slots numbered 0, 00, 1, 2, ..., 36. The
0 and 00 slots are green and half of the remaining 36 slots are red and half
are black. A croupier spins the wheel and throws in an ivory ball. If you bet
1 dollar on red, you win 1 dollar if the ball stops in a red slot and otherwise
you lose 1 dollar. Write a program to find the total winnings for a player who
makes 1000 bets on red.

Answer: for a thousand tries, on average you seem to lose on average 38% of the time for -398 dollars lost
