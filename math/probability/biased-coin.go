A biased coin is a coin that returns heads at probability P and (1-P) for tails.

To unbias a bias coin, toss it twice for the following outcomes:
HH - PP
HT - P(1-P)
TH - (1-P)P
TT - (1-P)(1-P)

This is known as a von neumann randomness extractor, we can use it to extract p=0.5 out of a bernoulli process

We can see that HT and TH have the same probability as each other
so we can treat HT pair as a H and TH as a T, and discard the other result
This can loop forever if P is 0 or 1, so need to have a bail condition
