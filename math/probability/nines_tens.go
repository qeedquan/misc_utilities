In the early 1600s, Galileo was asked to explain the fact that, although the
number of triples of integers from 1 to 6 with sum 9 is the same as the number
of such triples with sum 10, when three dice are rolled, a 9 seemed to come
up less often than a 10â€”supposedly in the experience of gamblers.
(a) Write a program to simulate the roll of three dice a large number of
times and keep track of the proportion of times that the sum is 9 and
the proportion of times it is 10.
(b) Can you conclude from your simulations that the gamblers is right?

Answer: gamblers seem to be wrong, in 1e6 to 1e8 simulation shows
that on average, it happens ~11.5% for 9 and ~12.5% for ten

if we brute force all sum pairs that gets us 6, we see
that the sum to pairs is ~11.5% and to ten is ~12.5%, so
this matches our experiment
