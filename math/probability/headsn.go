Toss a coin N times and records whether or not the proportion of heads is within .1 of .5 (i.e., between .4 and .6).
Have your program repeat this experiment 100 times.
About how large must n be so that approximately 95 out of 100 times the proportion of heads is between .4 and .6?

Answer: about 1-sqrt(n) >= 95 for a uniform random dice we increment the time when it hits heads, minus one otherwise,
we do this so it can "remember", if we reset every 100 times, it is as if it forgets what it obtained
