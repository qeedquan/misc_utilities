Crossover frequency - determines the closed loop bandwidth, rise time and settling time
Phase margin - determines damping and overshoot
Low frequency gain - determines steady state error

Lead/Lag compensators aims to affect the 3 above characteristics of a system, it is an alternative to PID controllers with the following characteristics:

1. It works on a range of frequencies instead of all frequencies over the breakpoint frequency as a PID controller does
2. PID controller adjusts the system's inputs based on an error signal that is calculated using the system's output, while lead-lag compensators adjust the system's frequency response to improve its performance.
3. A lead compensator can increase the stability or speed of reponse of a system; a lag compensator can reduce (but not eliminate) the steady-state error.
   Depending on the effect desired, one or more lead and lag compensators may be used in various combinations.

The transfer function:
G(s) = w_p/w_z * (s + w_z)/(s + w_p) where K = w_p/w_z
w_z < w_p (lead compensator)
w_z > w_p (lag compensator)

The above lead or lag transfer function can be cascaded to become a lead-lag compensator:
G(s) = (s-z1)*(s-z2) / ((s-p1)*(s-p2))

The lead compensator provides phase lead at high frequencies.
This shifts the root locus to the left, which enhances the responsiveness and stability of the system.
The lag compensator provides phase lag at low frequencies which reduces the steady state error.

The precise locations of the poles and zeros depend on both the desired characteristics of the closed loop response and the characteristics of the system being controlled.
However, the pole and zero of the lag compensator should be close together so as not to cause the poles to shift right, which could cause instability or slow convergence.
Since their purpose is to affect the low frequency behaviour, they should be near the origin.

*** Placing poles
For lead compensator, place the pole and zero of the lead compensator to the left of the plant poles and zeros.
In other words, we make the compensator faster so that the slower plant poles and zeros still dominate the behavior of the system
A good rule of thumb is to put the zero near the closed loop natural frequency, and to put the pole 5 to 20X away from the zero
We do not want to make the lead compensator too fast, however, because this will amplify high frequency noise.

Generally speaking, a lead compensator will contribute about 70 degrees to the phase margin.
If more phase is required, a double lead compensator can be used.
This compensator simply has 2 poles in the same location and 2 zeros in the same location.

Design process:

1. Check system type if you have a steady state error requirement using Final Value Theorem. Add a pole as necessary to get finite steady state error.
2. Determine the open loop gain required to meet the steady state error and bandwidth requirements. Use Final Value Theorem to solve for the gain K.
3. Evaluate the phase margin of the system with this gain.
4. Find the max phase that the lead compensator needs to add to the system by comparing the current phase margin with the desired phase margin and adding 10 degrees.

5. Find the ratio, alpha, between the zero and pole frequencies using the equation:
alpha = (1 - sin(theta_max)) / (1 + sin(theta_max))

6. Calculate the zero and pole frequencies using the following equations:
w_max = w_c
w_z = 1/T = w_max*sqrt(a)
w_p = 1/(a*T) = w_max/sqrt(a)

7. Check the phase margin again to see if it meets the design specification.
8. Iterate on the design until the specifications are met.
