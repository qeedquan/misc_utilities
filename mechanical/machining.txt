*** Processes
Common machining processes offered by vendors:

CNC Machining
SLA - Stereolithography
SLS - Selective Laser Sintering
DLP - Direct Digital Prod
Cast Urethane
QuickCast
DMP - Direct Metal Publishing
Sheet Metal
FDM - Fused Deposition Modeling
Printed Wax
Low Volume Injection Molding

The processes are basically using machines to cut/round/etc, casting (melting something and putting it into a mold), or printing

For low volume, price starts at around $100 for a simple STL files for the simplest models (like cases/etc) using 3d printing
CNC machine rentals are around a few hundred an hour.
Injection molding cost more than 3d printing/CNC because need to make the mold, but the mold can be reused after so good for high volume production

*** Materials
PC-Like Clear (Accura ClearVue)
ABS-Like Black
Ceramic Filled (Accura Bluestone)
ABS-Like High Temp (Accura 48)

*** Finishes
Paint Ready
Painted
Quick Clear
Matte (Low gloss, don't reflect alot of light)

*** Formats

Some vendors don't want to use CNC with STL models, STL models are more fitted to 3D printing (STL models are mainly triangle meshes)
However, vendors can give you an estimate of how much something can cost for manufacturing with only STL models
