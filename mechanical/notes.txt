*** Simulation

Simulate things like torque and truss

*** Running programs
On Linux systems that use wayland but the old programs are tied to x11, do this to make opengl init not fail

XDG_SESSION_TYPE="" ./program

*** File formats

STP
The standard format for 3D models, it exports geometry in forms of shape information like place circle here or axis there.
One issue is that it loses the information of CSG operations if the STP program was generated using something like NX.

AutoCad
Extension is .dwg/.dxf

Creo
Extension is .prt/.asm

Collada
Extension is .dae, XML based format made by Kronos group

*** Plastic Molding
The mold can cost anywhere from 100 to 100k to make depending on the design
The cost of the mold is also referred to as the tooling cost

Low volume: A 3D printed mold for low-volume production can cost as little as $100.
Simple: A simple mold can cost between $3,000 and $6,000.
Large or complex: A large, complex mold for high-production or multi-cavity use can cost $25,000 to $100,000 or more.
Typical: A typical mold for a simple part that's small enough to hold in your hand costs around $12,000.

The cost of a plastic injection mold can vary significantly based on several factors, including:
Complexity of the Design: More intricate designs require more sophisticated molds, which can increase costs.
Size of the Mold: Larger molds typically have higher costs due to the amount of material and machining required.
Material Used: The type of steel or aluminum used for the mold affects the price. Higher quality materials can lead to longer-lasting molds but at a higher cost.
Production Volume: Molds designed for high-volume production may have higher upfront costs but lower per-unit costs in the long run.
Location: Labor and manufacturing costs can differ significantly by region. For example, molds made in the U.S. may be more expensive than those made in countries with lower labor costs.
