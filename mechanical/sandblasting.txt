Sandblasting is a surface finishing process that uses high-pressure compressed air to propel solid particles against a surface, creating a variety of effects: 
Smoothing: Sandblasting can smooth rough surfaces and create a smoother, more even texture 
Roughening: Sandblasting can roughen smooth surfaces 
Removing contaminants: Sandblasting can remove surface contamination, paint, and other debris 
Shaping: Sandblasting can shape a surface 
Cleaning: Sandblasting can clean surfaces and prepare them for a new coat of paint, epoxy, or powder coating 

Sandblasting is also known as abrasive blasting. The intensity of the process can vary depending on the type of equipment, the pressure of the compressed air, and the type of abrasive material used. 
Sandblasting can be used on a variety of materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Some common abrasive materials used for sandblasting include: 
Staurolite: A weaker abrasive made from metamorphic rock that's good for removing thin layers of rust, scale, and paint 
Baking soda: Can be used to gently remove metal rust and clean surfaces without damaging the metal 
Corn cob or walnut shell: Can be used for blasting natural woods like log cabins or wooden furniture 

Sandblasting equipment can include:
Air blast rooms
Air blast tumble equipment
Portable blasting stations
Blast cabinets
Bulk blasting systems
Blast and recovery systems
Cryogenic deflashing systems
Wet blast equipment
